# Roadmap

## Overall goals

- To compile and curate the hundreds of operators into a single place,
   - to design them to interoperate with each other in straightforward-by-default ways.
   - to port concepts from langchain and elsewhere as needed, clarifying and testing and upgrading them.

- To compile and curate recipes for dozens of well-commented reference chains,

- To allow a smart but "not a programmer" enduser to take a reference recipe and tweak it for their own custom use;
   - to allow them to get moving on a prototype for their idea immediately;
   - to allow them to see into the process step-by-step;

- To provide them a platform for experimentation and small-scale production.

   - to provide an incentive and process for them to submit their work, for others to learn, and also to potentially improve the reference;
   - to compile test suites, so we can run A/B tests and gather data on specific prompt improvements, to continually optimize the reference chains.

operators + scripts + models + standardized tests = aipl

So that an AI proof-of-concept can be thrown together in an evening.
